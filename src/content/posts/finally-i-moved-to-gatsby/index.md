More than [5 years ago](/posts/i-moved-to-jekyll), I decided to move from WordPress to a static website based on Jekyll.

<figure class="float-right" style="width: 120px">
	<img src="/images/posts/finally-i-moved-to-gatsby/gatsby.webp" alt="Gatsby">
</figure>

After having enjoyed it for a long, I decided that the next step would have involved something fresher and, especially,
using [React](https://react.dev/), a Javascript library that I am learning to use. Therefore, the natural choice was to
move (again!) my blog to a React-based open source framework. I tested [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and I decided
that it was what I wanted.
