My name is Alberto Arena, and I'm Italian. I lived and worked in UK for 4 years, until I was finally back to the sunny
Mediterranean sea in Sicily. I can see the
wonderful [Strait of Messina](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Strait_of_Messina_from_Dinnammare.jpg) from my study
window: that sight makes my days easier.

I am a visionary pragmatist who loves coding (I apologise for the oxymoron!). I've been working as a Web developer
since 2005.

At the time being, I code mostly in **PHP** (Laravel, WordPress) and **Javascript** (lot of vanilla, VueJs).

You can follow me on [X, formerly Twitter](https://x.com/alberto_arena), or view
my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-arena-ba44a624/).

## Background and interests

My first approach to programming world was in 1985, when I started coding with my glorious Commodore 64! I can still
remember a program I wrote: it plotted all planets of solar system as "sprites". It was a start that led me
later to work with different languages like C and C++, Clipper, Delphi and finally PHP and Javascript.

I have a background of 9 years in C++ and Delphi, when I implemented data entry applications and ICR/OCR software using
Borland products. Good old days! Now my daily work is different, but I didn't lose my passion, and the desire to learn
new things.

I'm currently working as lead developer of [Midleton Distillery Collection](https://midletondistillerycollection.com/),
the official shop for Ireland's finest and best loved whiskey brands (Jameson, Redbreast, Midleton Very Rare, Powers,
Spot Whiskeys, Method & Madness and Knappogue Castle).

I have several personal interests, including reading, guitar, constructed languages, and hand-made dioramas.
