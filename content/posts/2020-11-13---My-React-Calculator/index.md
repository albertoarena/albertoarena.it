I am currently learning [React](https://react.dev/). I enjoy it. Iâ€™d like to use more and more in next projects, as it
is already part of the future of web development.

For that reason, I decided to create my own implementation of a calculator, extending
the [calculator](https://github.com/andrewagain/calculator) created by Andrew Farmer. Earlier, I had already created a
simple [PHP calculator](https://github.com/albertoarena/calculator) inspired
by [shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).

I am still working on a few details, but it has been a nice learning exercise. It has a basic and extended mode, and it
supports basic operators (+, -, /, \*, ^), trigonometric operators and precedence.

Feel free to [fork me on GitHub](https://github.com/albertoarena/react-calculator), and enjoy it!
