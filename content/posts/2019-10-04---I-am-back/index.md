My personal blog is back!

In the latest years, I didn’t have too much time to take care of my blog (shame!). I moved back to sunny Sicily becoming
100% remote, life has been busy and work even busier, days basically run away. “Time is an illusion”, Albert Einstein
said. My time, unfortunately, it isn’t.

In the meantime, I’ve done new experiences, read new books, and learnt new lessons.

One of the most influential book I read is
_[The Clean Coder. A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)_,
by Robert C. Martin, a.k.a. Uncle Bob. He has been a developer since 1970, and he faced with the same challenges that
today we, Web developers, cope with. As time goes by, fundamentals remain the same: testing strategies, estimation,
pressure, saying yes and saying no to your boss, working within a team and so on.

Martin’s book is not a tech book, so you won’t find diagrams, flowcharts or code samples. But as its title says, it’s a
code of conduct for serious and professional developers. I strongly suggest to anyone that has chosen to code as their
mission in life. I’m still learning from precious lessons that Uncle Bob shared, and I believe that reading it can only
elevate us.

Enjoy it!
